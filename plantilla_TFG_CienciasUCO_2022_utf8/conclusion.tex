Relative to the objectives stated in the chapter (ref objective chapter), and seeing the results obtained in the chapter (ref result chapter), the following conclusions can be made from this work.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Since all the obtained BAO observables were compatible with one another, the methodology followed in this work was the correct one. 
	\item For the given galaxy catalogue, the measured observables were $D_H /r_s = XXXX \pm XXXX$,  $D_M / r_s = XXXX \pm XXXX$.
	\item Specially, it was noted that there is no significative dependency of these observables with respect to changes in the parameter $\Omega_K$, in the studied interval.
\end{itemize}
